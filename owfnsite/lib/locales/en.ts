    "faq_q1": "What is the Official World Family Network (OWFN)?",
    "faq_a1": "OWFN is a social impact project built on the Solana blockchain. Our mission is to create a transparent and efficient ecosystem for funding humanitarian causes worldwide, effectively acting as a decentralized, community-governed charity.",
    "faq_q2": "How do I participate in the presale?",
    "faq_a2": "To participate, you will need a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom or Solflare) funded with SOL. Visit our [Visit Page: Presale] page during the active sale period, connect your wallet, enter the amount of SOL you wish to contribute, and approve the transaction.",
    "faq_q3": "Why was Solana chosen for this project?",
    "faq_a3": "Solana was chosen for its high transaction speeds, extremely low fees, and strong, growing ecosystem. These features are crucial for a project focused on social impact, as they ensure that the maximum amount of funds can go directly to causes rather than being consumed by network fees.",
    "faq_q4": "How is OWFN different from a traditional charity?",
    "faq_a4": "The key difference is transparency. All donations and distributions of funds are recorded on the blockchain, which is a public, immutable ledger. This allows anyone to track the flow of funds from donor to project. Additionally, OWFN aims to be governed by its token holders, giving the community a say in which projects are funded.",
    "faq_q5": "What is the OWFN token used for?",
    "faq_a5": "The $OWFN token is a utility token with several functions:\n1. **Governance**: Holders can vote on proposals, including which social impact projects to fund.\n2. **Donations**: The token can be used as a medium for donations within our ecosystem.\n3. **Staking**: Holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards and contribute to the network's stability.",
    "faq_q6": "How are the social impact projects chosen?",
    "faq_a6": "Initially, the core team will vet and select projects based on strict criteria. As the project matures, we will transition to a decentralized governance model where the community of OWFN token holders will vote on which projects to fund through the Impact Portal.",
    "faq_q7": "Is my donation tax-deductible?",
    "faq_a7": "As a decentralized, global project, OWFN is not registered as a traditional non-profit in any single jurisdiction. Therefore, donations are generally not tax-deductible. We recommend consulting with a tax professional in your country for specific advice.",
    "faq_q8": "When will I receive my tokens after the presale?",
    "faq_a8": "The OWFN tokens you purchase during the presale will be automatically airdropped to the same wallet you used for the purchase shortly after the presale period concludes. The exact date will be announced on our official channels.",
    "faq_q9": "How does OWFN ensure the funds are used correctly by the projects?",
    "faq_a9": "We will have a multi-faceted approach. First, we partner with reputable, established organizations. Second, we will require milestone-based reporting from projects. Third, funds will be disbursed in tranches as projects meet their goals. The transparency of the blockchain also allows for public auditing of fund movements.",
    "faq_q10": "What is 'Impact Staking'?",
    "faq_a10": "Impact Staking is a feature we plan to introduce where you can stake your OWFN tokens. A portion of the staking rewards, determined by you, can be automatically directed to the Impact Treasury, creating a continuous stream of funding for humanitarian projects.",
    "faq_q11": "What happens if the presale soft cap is not met?",
    "faq_a11": "In the unlikely event the soft cap is not reached, all contributed funds will be made available for participants to claim back. The project would then re-evaluate its strategy.",
    "faq_q12": "Are there any bonuses for participating in the presale?",
    "faq_a12": "Yes, we offer tiered bonuses based on the size of your contribution in a single transaction. Larger contributions receive a higher percentage of bonus tokens. You can find the specific tiers on the [Visit Page: Presale] page.",
    "faq_q13": "What will the token price be after listing?",
    "faq_a13": "The team cannot speculate on the future price of the token. The price after listing on a decentralized exchange (DEX) will be determined by market forces of supply and demand. The estimated DEX listing price is lower than the presale rate to reward early supporters.",
    "faq_q14": "What wallet should I use?",
    "faq_a14": "We recommend using a self-custodial Solana wallet like Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack. Do NOT send funds directly from a centralized exchange (like Coinbase or Binance) as you will not be able to receive the airdropped tokens.",
    "faq_q15": "What are Token-2022 Extensions?",
    "faq_a15": "Token-2022 is an updated token standard on Solana that allows for new features to be built directly into the token itself. We are using extensions for interest-bearing tokens (holders can earn passive yield) and transfer fees (a small fee on transactions that funds the treasury), which automates and secures core parts of our economic model.",
    "faq_q16": "Where can I see the project's official wallets?",
    "faq_a16": "Transparency is key. You can view all official project wallets and their real-time balances on our [Visit Page: Dashboard] page.",
    "faq_q17": "How can I get involved beyond just buying tokens?",
    "faq_a17": "The best way to help is to spread the word! Share our mission with your friends, family, and on social media. Join our community on Telegram and Discord to participate in discussions and stay up-to-date. As the project grows, there will be more opportunities for active community members to contribute.",
    "faq_q18": "What's the difference between the Telegram Channel and Group?",
    "faq_a18": "The Telegram Channel is for official announcements from the team only. The Telegram Group is for community discussion where everyone can chat and ask questions.",
    "faq_q20": "Is the project audited?",
    "faq_a20": "Security is a top priority. We plan to conduct a full audit of our smart contracts and token with a reputable third-party security firm before the mainnet launch of our dApp features like staking. Details of the audit will be made public once completed.",
