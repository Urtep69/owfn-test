    // FAQ Page
    faq_title: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    faq_subtitle: 'Find answers to the most common questions about OWFN.',
    faq_q1: 'What is OWFN?',
    faq_a1: `OWFN (Official World Family Network) is a Solana-based token designed to unite families globally through blockchain technology, focusing on social impact, education, health, and humanitarian aid with full transparency.`,
    faq_q2: 'How can I buy OWFN tokens?',
    faq_a2: `You can participate in the OWFN token presale directly through the link provided in the "Presale" section of our website. Make sure you have SOL (Solana) in your wallet to make the purchase.`,
    faq_q3: 'What is the total supply of OWFN tokens?',
    faq_a3: `The total supply of OWFN tokens is 18_000_000_000 (18 Billion) OWFN.`,
    faq_q4: 'How does OWFN ensure transparency in its social impact initiatives?',
    faq_a4: `OWFN utilizes the Solana blockchain to record all transactions related to its Impact Treasury. This ensures that every donation and allocation is publicly verifiable and immutable, providing full transparency.`,
    faq_q5: 'What does 2% APY mean for OWFN holders?',
    faq_a5: `OWFN is an Interest-Bearing Token (IBT) that automatically rewards its holders with a 2% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). This means your OWFN holdings will grow over time simply by keeping them in your wallet.`,
    faq_q6: 'Where can I find the OWFN Whitepaper?',
    faq_a6: `You can find the detailed OWFN Whitepaper by clicking on the "Whitepaper" button in the header or the main section of our website.`,
    faq_q7: `How does OWFN make a real-world difference?`,
    faq_a7: `OWFN directly funds initiatives in critical areas such as healthcare (e.g., covering surgery costs, hospital modernization), education (e.g., building and renovating schools, kindergartens), and basic needs (e.g., providing food, shelter, clothing for the homeless, establishing nursing homes). We also respond to disaster relief and invest in sustainable community development projects. Every token contributes to these concrete actions, ensuring 100% real support for humanity.`,
    faq_q8: 'How does my contribution through token purchase actually help?',
    faq_a8: `Your contribution helps in two fundamental ways. First, when you purchase tokens during the presale, a significant portion of the funds goes directly into the Impact Treasury to launch our social projects. Second, to create a sustainable, long-term funding source, a small 0.5% transfer fee will be activated on all transactions *after* the presale period concludes. This fee is designed as an automatic micro-donation to the Impact Treasury. It means that every time the token is used in the future, it generates continuous support for our humanitarian causes, turning the entire ecosystem into a perpetual force for good. All these financial flows are fully transparent on the blockchain.`,
    faq_q9: 'Besides buying tokens, how else can I get involved and help OWFN?',
    faq_a9: `Your involvement is crucial! Spreading the word about OWFN is incredibly powerful. Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues about our mission. Share our vision on social media, during your travels, or at work. Every conversation, every share, helps raise awareness and brings more people into our global family, amplifying our collective impact. Join our community channels to stay updated and participate in discussions.`,
    faq_q10: 'Are there any special instructions for donating USDC or USDT?',
    faq_a10: `Yes, this is critically important. All donations of USDC and USDT must be sent *exclusively* from the Solana blockchain. Do not send from any other network (e.g., Ethereum), as the funds will be lost and will not reach their destination. This information is clearly displayed on the donations page as well.`,
