    faq_q1: `What is OWFN?`,
    faq_a1: `OWFN (Official World Family Network) is a Solana-based token designed to unite families globally through blockchain technology, focusing on social impact, education, health, and humanitarian aid with full transparency.`,
    faq_q2: `How can I buy OWFN tokens?`,
    faq_a2: `You can participate in the OWFN token presale directly through the link provided in the "Presale" section of our website. Make sure you have SOL (Solana) in your wallet to make the purchase.`,
    faq_q3: `What is the total supply of OWFN tokens?`,
    faq_a3: `The total supply of OWFN tokens is 18,000,000,000 (18 Billion) OWFN.`,
    faq_q4: `How does OWFN ensure transparency in its social impact initiatives?`,
    faq_a4: `OWFN utilizes the Solana blockchain to record all transactions related to its Impact Treasury. This ensures every donation and allocation is publicly verifiable and immutable, providing full transparency.`,
    faq_q5: `What does 2% APY mean for OWFN holders?`,
    faq_a5: `OWFN is an Interest-Bearing Token (IBT) that automatically rewards its holders with a 2% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). This means your OWFN holdings will grow over time just by keeping them in your wallet.`,
    faq_q6: `Where can I find the OWFN Whitepaper?`,
    faq_a6: `You can find the detailed OWFN Whitepaper by clicking on the "Whitepaper" button in the header or main section of our website.`,
    faq_q7: `How does OWFN make a real-world difference?`,
    faq_a7: `OWFN directly funds initiatives in critical areas like healthcare (e.g., covering surgery costs, modernizing hospitals), education (e.g., building and renovating schools, kindergartens), and basic needs (e.g., providing food, shelter, clothing for the homeless, establishing nursing homes). We also respond to disaster relief and invest in sustainable community development projects. Every token contributes to these concrete actions, ensuring 100% real support for humanity.`,
    faq_q8: `How does my contribution, by buying tokens, actually help?`,
    faq_a8: `Your contribution helps in two fundamental ways. First, when you buy tokens during the presale, a significant portion of the funds go directly into the Impact Treasury to launch our social projects. Second, to create a sustainable, long-term funding source, a small 0.5% transfer fee will be activated on all transactions *after* the presale period concludes. This fee is designed as an automatic micro-donation to the Impact Treasury. This means every time the token is used in the future, it generates continuous support for our humanitarian causes, turning the entire ecosystem into a perpetual force for good. All of these financial flows are completely transparent on the blockchain.`,
    faq_q9: `Besides buying tokens, how else can I get involved and help OWFN?`,
    faq_a9: `Your involvement is crucial! Spreading the word about OWFN is incredibly powerful. Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues about our mission. Share our vision on social media, during your travels, or at work. Every conversation, every share, helps raise awareness and brings more people into our global family, amplifying our collective impact. Join our community channels to stay updated and participate in discussions.`,
    faq_q10: `Are there any special instructions for donating USDC or USDT?`,
    faq_a10: `Yes, this is critically important. All USDC and USDT donations must be sent *exclusively* from the Solana blockchain. Do not send from any other network (e.g., Ethereum), as the funds will be lost and will not reach their destination. This information is also clearly displayed on the donations page.`,
    faq_q11: 'What exactly happens after I buy tokens in the presale? Do I need to do anything?',
    faq_a11: 'No, after you have successfully completed the purchase of OWFN tokens during the presale, no further action is required from you. The tokens are automatically reserved for your wallet address. At the end of the presale period, all tokens will be automatically distributed (airdropped) to the buyers\' wallets.',
    faq_q12: 'When and where will I be able to trade (sell/buy) OWFN tokens after the presale?',
    faq_a12: 'According to our Roadmap, after the successful conclusion of the presale, we will proceed with the official listing of the $OWFN token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within the Solana ecosystem. The exact date and platforms will be announced on our official channels.',
    faq_q13: 'Why is there a maximum purchase limit (Max Buy) in the presale?',
    faq_a13: 'The maximum purchase limit is an important measure to ensure the fairest possible distribution of tokens and to prevent a small number of large investors ("whales") from controlling a significant portion of the supply. This promotes a healthier and more decentralized community in the long run.',
    faq_q14: 'What does it mean that the token is "Interest-Bearing" with 2% APY? How does it work?',
    faq_a14: 'It means the OWFN token is programmed to automatically generate interest. Just by holding the tokens in your Solana-compatible wallet, the amount of your tokens will increase over time, with a 2% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). You do not need to stake them or take any additional action; the rewards accumulate automatically.',
    faq_q15: 'What is the 0.5% transfer fee and when will it be activated?',
    faq_a15: 'This fee is a key mechanism for the long-term funding of our mission. A 0.5% fee will apply to all transactions with the OWFN token *after* the presale period concludes. The funds collected from this fee are automatically directed to the Impact Treasury to continuously fund our social projects. Thus, every transaction contributes to the common good.',
    faq_q16: 'Why did you choose the Solana blockchain for this project?',
    faq_a16: 'We chose Solana for its exceptional speed, very low transaction costs, and high scalability. These features are essential for a global project like ours, allowing for efficient micro-transactions and ensuring a fast and accessible experience for all users, whether they are donating, buying, or trading tokens.',
    faq_q17: 'How can I be sure that my donations reach the causes you support?',
    faq_a17: 'Transparency is fundamental to us. All funds intended for social causes are managed through the Impact Treasury, whose wallet address is public. You can monitor all incoming and outgoing transactions on a Solana block explorer, such as Solscan. In addition, on the Impact Portal, we will provide regular updates and detailed reports on the funded projects.',
    faq_q18: 'Can I propose a social case or a cause to be funded by OWFN?',
    faq_a18: 'In the initial phase, projects are selected by our team based on strict criteria of impact and feasibility. As the project progresses, we will implement a governance system (DAO) that will allow community members to propose and vote on future initiatives, giving you a direct role in directing the funds.',
    faq_q19: 'Who is behind the OWFN project? Is the team anonymous?',
    // FIX: Changed faq_a20 to faq_a19 to fix duplicate key error.
    faq_a19: 'Details about our team\'s vision and values are presented on the website. As we get closer to the public launch, we will provide more transparency regarding the key members and advisors who contribute to the project\'s success, while respecting their safety and privacy.',
    faq_q20: 'What security measures have you taken to protect the project\'s and investors\' funds?',
    faq_a20: 'Security is our top priority. We use multi-signature wallets for managing critical funds, which means no single transaction can be approved by one person. The token\'s smart contract will be audited by reputable security firms to identify and correct any potential vulnerabilities before launch.',
